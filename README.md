# BreastCancerClassification_CNN-DL
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying malignant and benign breast tumors using the INbreast dataset. This project implements deep learning techniques, including batch normalization, dropout regularization, and global average pooling, to enhance classification accuracy and prevent overfitting.
